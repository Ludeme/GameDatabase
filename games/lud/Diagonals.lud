            Two lines can be finished on one turn, the player achieves points for both lines (the dropped stone counts twice, once for each diagonal).
            A diagonal line must have at least 2 stones. So, corner cells do not count as diagonals.
            
        GOAL - When all cells are occupied, wins the player with more points.")
