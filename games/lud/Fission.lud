        (description "Fission is a game where players attempt to eliminate all of their opponents stones but must have at least one stone left on the board in order to win.")
        (rules "TURN - On each turn, each player slides (orthogonally or diagonally) a stone until it hits another stone or a wall.
            
            If it stops because of a stone, the moving stone and all adjacent stones (of either color) are removed.
            
            GOAL - The player with no stones onboard loses.
            
        The game is a draw if (i) the board becomes empty, or (ii) each player has just one stone, or (iii) the moving player has no valid moves.")
