        (description "Atoll is a two player game played on a hexagonal pattern grid. The game starts with eight “islands” of stones surrounding
        an empty grid. Each player takes possession of an entire set of stones of one color, black or white. Each player owns the islands of his stones’ color. ")
        (rules "STONE PLACEMENT Players take turns adding their stones to the board, one stone per turn. Black makes the first placement of the game. Each player will always have a placement available on his turn and must
            make one.
            
        OBJECT OF THE GAME To win you must connect two of your islands, which are exactly opposite each other, with a contiguous sequence of your stones. The stones of your islands can be included in the sequence. ")
