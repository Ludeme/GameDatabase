        (description "Polis is a board game mentioned in ancient Greek literary sources. Little is known about it, but the sources indicate that the spaces were called poleis, \"cities,\" and a piece was called κύων (kyon), \"dog\". Captures were involved, and it has been speculated that the game is similar to Ludus Latrunculorum.")
