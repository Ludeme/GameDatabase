            - Drop a friendly stone at an empty cell, which is in a diagonal line of sight with another friendly stone, i.e., both stones must be separated by a diagonal line of empty cells. 
            - Transform an enemy stone, at a diagonal line of sight of a friendly stone, into a wall (which is a neutral stone).
            
        GOAL - When there are no valid moves, wins the player with more friendly stones.")
