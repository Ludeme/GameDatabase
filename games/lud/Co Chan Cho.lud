Two pieces per player, which begin on opposite corners of the square, one player to the left of the side with the X and the other to the right. Players alternate  turns moving  one of their pieces along the lines of the board to an empty adjacent point. Players cannot move along the line marked with an X. When one player  cannot move, the opponent wins.")
