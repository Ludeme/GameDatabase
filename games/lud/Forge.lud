            - At the first move, a player may choose any of his stones to move.
            - After that, a player must move a stone that is adjacent to the last moved enemy stone. If that is not possible, the player may choose any unblocked of his stones to move. 
            - There is no capturing.
            
        GOAL  - Wins the player that moved the last stone.")
