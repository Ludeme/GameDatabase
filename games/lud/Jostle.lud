        (rules "OBJECT OF THE GAME The last player to make a move wins.
            
            FRIENDLY AND ENEMY CONNECTIONS A connection, i.e. an orthogonal
            adjacency between two checkers, is friendly if the two checkers are the same color and enemy if the two checkers are oppositely colored. 
            
            CHECKER VALUE A checker’s value is its number of friendly connections minus
            its number of enemy connections.
            
            MOVES A checker’s value must increase when it‘s moved. Move a checker to an
            unoccupied, orthogonally adjacent square.
            
        There is no capturing in Jostle, only jostling.")
